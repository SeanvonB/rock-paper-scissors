# Rock Paper Scissors

This simple game is the first real project that I completed using a programming language, and it was an important milestone for my understanding of lists, dictionaries, functions, classes and class methods, basic input validation, and the command line interface. Behold my humble beginnings!

You can check it out by running `rps.py` from your command line.

## Features
